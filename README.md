# MentalHealthChatbot
Our Mental Chatbot is an AI-powered tool designed to provide emotional support and guidance to individuals struggling with mental health issues. This Chatbot uses natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries, providing personalized advice and coping strategies to manage mental health concerns. 

You need to perform the following steps to connect Dialogflow with the Flutter Application:

1.You need to login to Dialogflow to create the responses which will be displayed by the Chatbot.

2.  Go to https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/ and signin with your Google Account. 

3. Create an agent in Dialogflow. 

4. You will get two default intents, for "greeting" and "did not understand".

5. You can Add or delete your own intents. 

6. Now go to settings and find the project id. 

7. Find the same project in cloud console. 

8. Add a service account and create a json key and download it.

9. Put this key in assets folder of your Flutter Project.

Thats all!
